# Eyes Toolkit

## Daily Practices for Eye Health

- Focus on periodically letting your **eyes relax** throughout the day. Try taking calls or joining a meeting while
  sitting outside or while walking, or look out a window to the furthest location you can. You don’t need to fixate on
  one visual location; rather, viewing to multiple distances far away (beyond 3 feet out to infinity) is key.
- For every 30-60 minutes of up-close work, allow all your face **muscles to relax** (including the jaw muscles) for 1-5
  minutes or so while viewing things further out in the distance.
- Get outside for a walk, run or bike ride. Don’t read on your phone for more than a glance or so while doing these
  activities, of course! The panoramic vision and optic flow induced by self-generated movement can **reduce
  anxiety** and **improve mood** . Alas, while exercise is good, optic flow is not the same on a stationary bike or
  treadmill. Get outside and move as best and as often as you safely can.
- Try to get **outside for 2+ hours a day** , preferably without sunglasses.

## Exercises

1. **Smooth Pursuit Eye Task** – Practice following a small object with your eyes. Try to follow the object with smooth
   eye movements — not allowing eyes to dart from one point to another.
   - In nature, practice this type of eye movement by watching a bird in flight. Or, during a sports game, try smoothly
     tracking a tennis ball, golf ball or hockey puck. You can also practice this exercise at
     your [computer](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/o8u9d2rr0esqhkw53pgiv/l2hehmh34nqlqeig/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9WaXN1YWxFeGVyY2lzZXMvdmlkZW9z) .
   - Try to complete this type of exercise for 2-3 minutes, 3x per week.
2. **Near-Far Exercises** – Accommodation is the eye’s ability to adjust focus to objects near or farther away by
   changing the optics of the eye and lens itself. As some of you might have already experienced, this ability naturally
   declines with age, and it takes more time to focus on objects at different distances (e.g., focusing on a server at a
   restaurant, then looking down to read the menu).
   - Train eye muscles by visually focusing on a pen or other small object positioned about 1.5 feet in front of your
     eyes. Slowly, move the object closer toward your nose while keeping the object in focus. Continue to move the
     object closer and closer until the image gets blurry.
     - With practice, your ability to move the object nearer to you while maintaining sharp focus will improve. The
       effort involved will also be less over time.
     - You can also practice this exercise in reverse: focus on an object near to you, then move it farther away.
   - Improve your control of eye muscles and the associated neural connections by practicing this exercise for around
     1-2 minutes every other day.
