In this document I keep recommendations, tips and resources for optimizing sleep.

## ☀️ Sunlight exposure

- View sunlight within 30-60 min of waking up and in the late afternoon, prior to sunset
  - Triggers cortisol increase early in the day
  - Helps set timer for falling asleep later at night
- 5 min on bright days, 20 min on cloudy days
- Avoid sunglasses

## 🌡️ Temperature regulation

- Increase core body temperature early in the day
  - Cold water exposure (1-3 minutes)
    - Cold showers, ice baths, or cold tubs
    - Releases adrenaline and dopamine, increases alertness
  - Exercise to increase core body temperature
    - Immediately upon waking
    - Activities: walking, jogging, skipping rope, light calisthenics
    - Exercise at least 5-6 days per week

## ☕️ Caffeine management

- Delay caffeine intake for 90-120 minutes after waking
  - Helps avoid afternoon crash and promotes wakefulness
- Avoid caffeine intake 8-10 hours before bedtime

- Optimal bedroom temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows
