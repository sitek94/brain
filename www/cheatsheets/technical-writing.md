# Technical Writing

My notes from [Technical Writing Course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/overview) by Google.

## TLDR;

- Use terms consistently.
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns.
- Prefer active voice to passive voice.
- Pick specific verbs over vague ones.
- Focus each sentence on a single idea.
- Convert some long sentences to lists.
- Eliminate unneeded words.
- Use a numbered list when ordering is important and a bulleted list when ordering is irrelevant.
- Keep list items parallel.
- Start numbered list items with imperative words.
- Introduce lists and tables appropriately.
- Create great opening sentences that establish a paragraph's central point.
- Focus each paragraph on a single topic.
- Determine what your audience needs to learn.
- Fit documentation to your audience.
- Establish your document's key points at the start of the document.

## [Words](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words)

- Define new or unfamiliar terms
  - If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation.
  - If you introduce one new term, define it, if many terms create glossary.
- [Use terms consistently](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words#use_terms_consistently)
- Acronyms
  - Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
  - Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    - The acronym appears many times in the document.
- [Recognize ambiguous pronouns](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words#recognize_ambiguous_pronouns)
  - Only use a pronoun _after_ you've introduced the noun.
  - Place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun.
  - If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.

## [Active voice](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/active-voice)

- [Prefer active voice to passive voice](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/active-voice#prefer_active_voice_to_passive_voice)

## [Clear sentences](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/clear-sentences)

- [Choose strong verbs](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/clear-sentences#choose_strong_verbs)
  - To engage and educate readers, choose precise, strong, specific verbs.
  - Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic verbs, such as the following:
    - forms of _be_: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
    - occur
    - happen
- [Reduce there is / there are](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/clear-sentences#reduce_there_is_there_are)
  - In the best-case scenario, you may simply delete **There is** or **There are**.
  - Try to repair a **There is** or **There are** sentence by moving the true subject and true verb from the end of the
    sentence to the beginning.
- [Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/clear-sentences#minimize_certain_adjectives_and_adverbs_optional)
  - Feed your technical readers factual data instead of marketing speak, e.g.
    - "Setting this flag makes the application run **screamingly** fast."
    - "Setting this flag makes the application run **225-250%** faster."

## [Short sentences](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences)

- Focus each sentence on a single idea
- Convert long sentences to lists
- Eliminate or reduce extraneous words
  - [Common bloated phrases example](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences#:~:text=The%20following%20table%20suggests%20replacements%20for%20a%20few%20common%20bloated%20phrases%3A)
- [Reduce subordinate clauses (optional)](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences#reduce_subordinate_clauses_optional)
- [Distinguish that from which](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences#distinguish_that_from_which)
  - In some countries **that** and **which** are interchangeable.
  - In US:
    - which - nonessential subordinate clauses
    - that - essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without
  - Place a comma before **which**; do not place a comma before **that**.

## [Lists and tables](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/lists-and-tables)

- Choose the correct type of list: bulleted, numbered or embedded.
- Keep list items parallel, example of parallel list:
  - all items are plural nouns (grammar)
  - edible (logical category)
  - lower case (capitalization)
  - without periods or commas (punctuation)
- Start numbered list items with imperative verbs, e.g.
  1.  Download the app.
  2.  Configure the app's settings.
  3.  Start the app.
- Punctuate items appropriately:
  - If the list item is a sentence, use sentence capitalization and punctuation.
  - Otherwise do not use sentence capitalization and punctuation.
- Create useful tables:
  - Label each column with a meaningful header.
  - Avoid too much text in a cell. More than two sentences is too much.
  - Make sure individual columns have the same data type.
- Introduce each list and table with a sentence that tells what the list or table represents.
  - Terminate the sentence with a colon.
  - Use the word "following" in this sentence.

## [Paragraphs](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/paragraphs)

- Write great opening sentence
  - sometimes readers read only first sentence and skip the rest
  - it should state the theme of the paragraph
  - effective opening sentence could be also a rhetorical question, which can engage readers
- Focus each paragraph on a single topic
  - remove or move any sentence that doesn't directly relate to the current topic
- Don't make paragraphs too long or too short
  - 3-5 - the best
  - 7 or more - readers will avoid reading it
  - a lot of 1-sentence paragraphs - bad, try to combine ideas or use lists instead
- Answer what, why and how
  - What are you trying to tell your reader?
  - Why is it important for the reader to know this?
  - How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?

## [Audience](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/audience)

- Define your audience
  - Identify your audience's role(s)
  - Consider your audience proximity to the knowledge.
    - The average heart specialist knows more about ear problems than the average software engineer but far less than an
      audiologist.
- [Determine what your audience needs to learn](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/audience#determine_what_your_audience_needs_to_learn)
- Fit documentation to your audience
  - Vocabulary and concepts
    - The broader your audience the more you should explain.
  - Curse of knowledge
    - As expert, remember that novices don't know what you already know.

## [Documents](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/documents)

- State your document's scope
  - What's in scope and what's out of scope?
- State your audience
  - Explicitly specify your audience.
  - Specify any prerequisite knowledge or experience.
  - In some cases specify prerequisite reading or coursework.
- Summarize key points at the start
  - Ensure that the start of your document answers your readers' essential questions.
- [Compare and contrast](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/documents#compare_and_contrast)
- [Write for your audience](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/documents#write_for_your_audience)
  - Define your audience's needs
  - Organize the document to meet your audience's needs

## [Punctuation](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/punctuation)

- Commas
  - Insert comma wherever a reader would naturally pause somewhere within a sentence.
  - In sentences with condition, place a comma between the condition and theconsequence.
  - Avoid using a comma to paste together two independent thoughts.
- [Semicolons](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/punctuation#semicolons)
  - Use semicolon to unite highly related thoughts.
- [Em dashes, en dashes and hyphens](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/punctuation#en_dashes_and_hyphens)
  - Em dash represents a longer pause - a bigger break - than a comma.
  - Don't use en dash.
  - Hyphens connect words in certain compound terms.
- Parentheses
  - Use parentheses to hold minor points and digressions.
  - Enclosed text isn't critical.
  - Keep them to minimum.
