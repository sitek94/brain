# Add overlay color to &lt;img&gt; tag

If you want to change the color of a remote image, that you display using the `<img>` tag, like this:

```html
<img alt="logo" src="https://example.com/logo.png" />
```

You can use [CSS filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) property. It offers a variety of
different color functions, which you can use to change the color of your image, like `contrast`, `hue-rotate` or
`saturate`.

Of course, trying to find the correct color manually would be extremely hard. Fortunately, some smart people created
tools like [this one](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter/), where you enter a target HEX color and it
gives you back a computed filter property value.

All you have to do now, is add it in your CSS:

```css
img {
  filter: invert(2%) sepia(82%) saturate(4192%) hue-rotate(242deg) brightness(102%) contrast(98%);
}
```
